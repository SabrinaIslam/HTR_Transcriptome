In git, new lines are green.
I am going to add this line.

def addition(a, b):
  summation = a + b
  return summation
def subtraction(a, b):
  difference = a - b
  return difference
def division(a, b):
  quotient = a / b
  return quotient
def multiplication(a, b):
  product = a * b
 return product
def bad_addition(a, b):
summation = a + b + 0.002
return summation
def bad_subtraction(a, b):
difference = a - b + 7
return difference
